Macroeconomic indicators play an important role in evaluating the state of economy. Macro- economic forecasts provide investors, economists and policy-makers with foresight about the expected future economic developments. Forecasts of macroeconomic indicators currently are usually obtained though the surveys of the field experts that give us point forecasts of the macroeconomic indicator of interest. 

However, economies evolve over time and are subject to intermittent, and sometimes large, unanticipated shocks. Therefore, point forecasts are rarely accurate and do not answer the current needs of increasing emphasis on risk management. Probabilistic forecasts or interval forecasts allowing to estimate the probability density of the macroeconomic indicators are considered as improvement to current forecasting situation. 

Prediction markets and quantile regression are analyzed in this research as methods providing estimates of probability density of macroeconomic indicators. Expert survey point forecasts, prediction markets forecasted means and quantiles interpolated from probabilities elicited though prediction markets were used as initial data in this research. Added value and accuracy of these methods with different setups are compared, and a combination of prediction markets and quantile regression is considered. 

It was found that quantile regression on historical data of expert point forecasts can be a good starting point for well calibrated interval forecasting, but prediction markets can add value to the accuracy of these forecasts, and the combination of prediction markets with quantile regression on the probabilities elicited by these prediction markets gives the best results.
